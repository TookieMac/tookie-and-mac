to view and edit  the included UML diagram download UMLet or some other modelling tool.
if it turns out to be too much of a hastle to have the UML diagram on git, i'll upload it to OneDrive and i can share a link to it instead.

we still need to decide on what we want to program, or if we should just do some general programming for now.

to use the toolset i use (first download it once i give it to you), then got to the project and bring up the right click menu then go to properties->java build path->libraries->add external JAR's then navigate the new window to the download location and select TookieTools
